# Image-Compression-using-Quad-Trees

We can reduce Image size by reducing image color details using this program. 

working: Image is recursively divided into four subparts until the difference between average R,G,B and majority R,G,B value is less than threshold.

Pixel matrix of image is extracted from BMP image file.

Programming language: C
Data Structure used: Quad Trees
